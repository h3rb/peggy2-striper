Peggy2 Stripe Morpher for Evil Mad Scientist's Peggy 2.0


Description
-----------

Peggy2 Stripe Morpher

- Written for 25 parallel strips of RGBW...R configuration (vertically homogenous RGBW x-aligned), I made my Peggy2 off-spec instead of making square pixels I made a line of pixels similar to actual phosphor CRT pixel configurations on classic "boob tube" television sets.
- Works fine with RGBW square "superpixel" or monochrome or other off-spec configurations
- Based on Qix Peggy2Lib demo.

 Based in Peggy2_Qix:
 Create a light that bounces off Paggy's "walls", and leaves a tail of 4 lights behind it of decreasing brightness
