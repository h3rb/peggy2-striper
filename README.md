Peggy2 Stripe Morpher for Evil Mad Scientist's Peggy 2.0


Description
-----------

Peggy2 Stripe Morpher

- Written for 25 parallel strips of RGBW...R configuration (vertically homogenous RGBW x-aligned), I made my Peggy2 off-spec instead of making square pixels I made a line of pixels similar to actual phosphor CRT pixel configurations on classic "boob tube" television sets.  Same color is aligned along a vertical line creating about 9 pixels wide and 25 pixels tall instead of the grid configuration found on most peggy2 RGBWs.
- Works fine with RGBW square "superpixel" or monochrome or other off-spec configurations
- Makes your Peggy2 look like a 1970s TV sci-fi panel with ever-changing morphing Qix-based animations that have varying parameters and constraints.
